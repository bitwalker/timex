  Compare two date or datetime types.

  You can optionally specify a comparison granularity, any of the following:

  - :years
  - :months
  - :weeks
  - :calendar_weeks (weeks of the calendar as opposed to actual weeks in terms of days)
  - :days
  - :hours
  - :minutes
  - :seconds
  - :milliseconds
  - :microseconds (default)
  - :duration

  and the dates will be compared with the cooresponding accuracy.
  The default granularity is :microseconds.

    - 0:  when equal
    - -1: when the first date/time comes before the second
    - 1:  when the first date/time comes after the second
    - {:error, reason}: when there was a problem comparing,
      perhaps due to a value being passed which is not a valid date/datetime
