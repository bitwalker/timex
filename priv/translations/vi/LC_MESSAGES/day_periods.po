## This file is a PO Template file.

## `msgid`s here are often extracted from source code.
## Add new translations manually only if they're dynamic
## translations that can't be statically extracted.
##
## Run `mix gettext.extract` to bring this file up to
## date. Leave `msgstr`s empty as changing them here as no
## effect: edit them in PO (`.po`) files instead.
