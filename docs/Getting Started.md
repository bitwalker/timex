# Getting Started

**Learn how to add timex to your Elixir project and start using it.**

If you are looking for a general reference of what functions are available to you, take a
look at the `Timex`, `Timex.Interval`, `Timex.Duration` modules, as they cover
the vast majority of functionality you will care about.

## Project Setup

To use Timex with your projects, edit your `mix.exs` file and add it as a dependency, as well as add `:timex` to your applications list.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:timex, "~> 3.0"}]
end
```

To use Timex modules without the Timex namespace, add `use Timex` to the top of each module you plan on referencing Timex from. You can then reference the modules directly, for example: `Duration.now`, versus `Timex.Duration.now`. You can also alias individual modules if that suits your needs better, but for purposes of this documentation, we'll assume that you're going the `use Timex` route.

### What Is Timex

Timex aims to be the richest, most comprehensive date/time library for Elixir projects, with the ultimate goal of being merged into the standard library, if such functionality is ever considered for inclusion.

A rough list of current features:

- create datetimes in an arbitrary timezone
- create datetimes from Erlang dates or datetimes
- get dates/datetimes representing special points in time:
  - end/beginning of year
  - end/beginning of quarter
  - end/beginning of month
  - end/beginning of week
  - end/beginning of day
- convert to/from dates/datetimes in various units (seconds, minutes, hours, etc.) since year zero or UNIX epoch
- convert to/from dates/datetimes in various standard ISO forms:
  - ISO triplets
  - ISO day
  - ISO week
- convert to/from dates/datetimes in various formats:
  - gregorian
  - gregorian_seconds
  - Erlang dates or datetimes
  - UNIX timestamps
- shift datetimes across timezones
- shift dates/datetimes through time using various units
- format/parse datetime strings
- compare and diff dates/datetimes
- normalize dates/datetimes
- create intervals between points in time which can be enumerated
- create timestamps and convert them to other time units
- compare and diff timestamps and various time units
- measure execution time of a function
- add and subtract time or datetimes
- and more..
